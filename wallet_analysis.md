# Cardano Wallet Balance Analysis

## Overview of Balance Discrepancy
Analysis performed on December 31, 2024, revealed why some Cardano wallets may display different ADA balances than blockchain explorers.

## Current Wallet State

### UTXO Structure
Total Balance: **4.988528 ₳** split across 3 UTXOs:
1. UTXO 1: 1.573526 ₳ (clean ADA, no tokens)
2. UTXO 2: 2.137760 ₳ (with 9 tokens including YUMMI)
3. UTXO 3: 1.277242 ₳ (clean ADA, no tokens)

### Token-Locked ADA Analysis
The UTXO containing tokens (UTXO 2) has insufficient ADA:
- Current ADA: 2.137760 ₳
- Minimum Required: 2.350000 ₳ (for 9 tokens)
- Deficit: -0.212240 ₳

### Why Different Balances Are Shown
The wallet shows **2.85 ₳** because it's only counting "freely spendable" ADA:
- UTXO 1: 1.573526 ₳
- UTXO 3: 1.277242 ₳
- Total: ~2.85 ₳

The remaining 2.137760 ₳ is locked with tokens and not shown in the spendable balance.

## Transaction Analysis

### Recent Transaction Patterns
In the last 10 transactions:
- 4 transactions split UTXOs
- 9 transactions involved tokens

### YUMMI Token Holder Analysis
Study of other YUMMI token holders:
- Sample size: 10 addresses
- 100% have multiple UTXOs
- Pattern suggests this is common for YUMMI token holders

### Latest Transaction Details
Transaction on Dec 31, 11:10:52:
- **Inputs**: 4.814625 ₳ total
- **Outputs**:
  - 1.211110 ₳ (external address)
  - 2.137760 ₳ (returned with tokens)
  - 1.277242 ₳ (returned as clean ADA)
- **Fee**: 0.188513 ₳

## Additional Assets

### Staking Information
- Available Rewards: 73.868060 ₳
- Total Balance (including rewards): 78.856588 ₳

### Token Holdings
- YUMMI Balance: 25,000 YUMMI
- Other NFTs: 8 unique tokens

## Recommendations
1. Consider consolidating UTXOs when possible to reduce fragmentation
2. Ensure token-holding UTXOs maintain sufficient ADA to meet minimum requirements
3. Be aware that wallet displays may vary based on how they handle token-locked ADA
